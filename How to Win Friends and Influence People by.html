Note: I have made minor changes to this work, including a contents page, covers
etc. I did not scan this work (I only have the 1964 version) but decided to
edit it since I am working on Dale's other book &quot;How To Stop Worrying and
Start Living&quot; and thought it best to make minor improvements. Parts 5 and
6 were scanned and added to this version by me, they were not included (for

had finally realized, after years of observation and experience, that the
highest-paid personnel in engineering are frequently not those who know the
most about engineering. One can for example, hire mere technical ability in
engineering, accountancy, architecture or any other profession at nominal

United States Marines into the district to drive off competitors whose adjacent

During the night of July 4, Lee began to retreat southward while storm clouds
deluged the country with rain. When Lee reached the Potomac with his defeated
army, he found a swollen, impassable river in front of him, and a victorious
Union Army behind him. Lee was in a trap. He couldn't escape. Lincoln saw that.
Here was a golden, heaven-sent opportunity-the opportunity to capture Lee's
army and end the war immediately. So, with a surge of high hope, Lincoln
ordered Meade not to call a council of war but to attack Lee immediately.

authors, and I asked Davis to tell me about his method of work. A few weeks
earlier, I had received a letter from someone with this notation at the bottom:
&quot;Dictated but not read.&quot; I was quite impressed. I felt that the
writer must be very big and busy and important. I wasn't the slightest bit
busy, but I was eager to make an impression on Richard Harding Davis, so I
ended my short note with the words: &quot;Dictated but not read.&quot;</span></p>

the death of Richard Harding Davis ten years later, the one thought that still
persisted in my mind - I am ashamed to admit - was the hurt he had given me.</span></p>

years ago a teacher in Detroit asked Stevie Morris to help her find a mouse
that was lost in the classroom. You see, she appreciated the fact that nature
had given Stevie something no one else in the room had. Nature had given Stevie
a remarkable pair of ears to compensate for his blind eyes. But this was really
the first time Stevie had been shown appreciation for those talented ears. Now,
years later, he says that this act of appreciation was the beginning of a new
life. You see, from that time on he developed his gift of hearing and went on
to become, under the stage name of Stevie Wonder, one of the great pop singers

character and disposition. I then asked him or her to tell me the month and day

myself, &quot;November 24, November 24.&quot; The minute my friend's back was
turned, I wrote down the name and birthday and later would transfer it to a
birthday book. At the beginning of each year, I had these birthday dates
scheduled in my calendar pad so that they came to my attention automatically.

our hearts. We are incredibly heedless in the formation of our beliefs, but
find ourselves filled with an illicit passion for them when anyone proposes to
rob us of their companionship. It is obviously not the ideas themselves that
are dear to us, but our self-esteem which is threatened. ... The little word
&quot;my&quot; is the most important one in human affairs, and properly to
reckon with it is the beginning of wisdom. It has the same force whether it is
&quot;my&quot; dinner, &quot;my&quot; dog, and &quot;my&quot; house, or
&quot;my&quot; father, &quot;my&quot; country, and &quot;my&quot; God. We not
only resent the imputation that our watch is wrong, or our car shabby, but that
our conception of the canals of Mars, of the pronunciation of
&quot;Epictetus,&quot; of the medicinal value of salicin, or of the date of
Sargon I is subject to revision. We like to continue to believe what we have
been accustomed to accept as true, and the resentment aroused when doubt is
cast upon any of our assumptions leads us to seek every manner of excuse for
clinging to it. The result is that most of our so-called reasoning consists in
finding arguments for going on believing as we already do.</span></p>

imported a fix'd opinion, such as 'certainly,' 'undoubtedly,' etc., and I
adopted, instead of them, 'I conceive,' 'I apprehend, ' or 'I imagine' a thing
to be so or so, or 'it so appears to me at present.' When another asserted
something that I thought an error, I deny'd myself the pleasure of
contradicting him abruptly, and of showing immediately some absurdity in his
proposition: and in answering I began by observing that in certain cases or
circumstances his opinion would be right, but in the present case there
appear'd or seem'd to me some difference, etc. I soon found the advantage of
this change in my manner; the conversations I engag'd in went on more
pleasantly. The modest way in which I propos'd my opinions procur'd them a

expanded our inventory and capabilities to enable us to run more than twelve

executives have learned that it pays to be friendly to strikers. For example,
when 2,500 employees in the White Motor Company's plant struck for higher wages
and a union shop, Robert F. Black, then president of the company, didn't lose
his temper and condemn and threaten and talk of tryanny and Communists. He
actually praised the strikers. He published an advertisement in the Cleveland
papers, complimenting them on &quot;the peaceful way in which they laid down
their tools.&quot; Finding the strike pickets idle, he bought them a couple of
dozen baseball bats and gloves and invited them to play ball on vacant lots.

battling for higher wages and recognition of the union. Such an event had never

am. See the old man down there with a coat? I bet I can get his coat off him

they no longer rented bows because they couldn't afford to do so. He then asked
me if I had rented before. I replied, 'Yes, several years ago.' He reminded me
that I probably paid $25 to $30 for the rental. I said 'yes' again. He then
asked if I was the kind of person who liked to save money. Naturally, I
answered 'yes.' He went on to explain that they had bow sets with all the
necessary equipment on sale for $34.95. I could buy a complete set for only
$4.95 more than I could rent one. He explained that is why they had
discontinued renting them. Did I think that was reasonable? My 'yes' response
led to a purchase of the set, and when I picked it up I purchased several more
items at this shop and have since become a regular customer.&quot;</span></p>

always enjoyed walking and riding in a park near my home. Like the Druids of
ancient Gaul, I all but worship an oak tree, so I was distressed season after
season to see the young trees and shrubs killed off by needless fires. These
fires weren't caused by careless smokers. They were almost all caused by
youngsters who went out to the park to go native and cook a frankfurter or an
egg under the trees. Sometimes, these fires raged so fiercely that the fire
department had to be called out to fight the conflagration.</span></p>

was a sign on the edge of the park saying that anyone who started a fire was
liable to fine and imprisonment, but the sign stood in an unfrequented part of
the park, and few of the culprits ever saw it. A mounted policeman was supposed
to look after the park; but he didn't take his duties too seriously, and the
fires continued to spread season after season. On one occasion, I rushed up to
a policeman and told him about a fire spreading rapidly through the park and
wanted him to notify the fire department, and he nonchalantly replied that it
was none of his business because it wasn't in his precinct! I was desperate, so
after that when I went riding, I acted as a self-appointed committee of one to
protect the public domain. In the beginning, I am afraid I didn't even attempt
to see the other people's point of view. When I saw a fire blazing under the
trees, I was so unhappy about it, so eager to do the right thing, that I did

Naturally, I knew she had lived and written her immortal books in Concord,
Massachusetts. But, without thinking what I was saying, I spoke of visiting her
old home in Concord. New Hampshire. If I had said New Hampshire only once, it
might have been forgiven. But, alas and alack! I said it twice, I was deluged
with letters and telegrams, stinging messages that swirled around my
defenseless head like a swarm of hornets. Many were indignant. A few insulting.
One Colonial Dame, who had been reared in Concord, Massachusetts, and who was
then living in Philadelphia, vented her scorching wrath upon me. She couldn't
have been much more bitter if I had accused Miss Alcott of being a cannibal
from New Guinea. As I read the letter, I said to myself, &quot;Thank God, I am
not married to that woman.&quot; I felt like writing and telling her that

one requiring technical qualification, and following the recommendation of the
head of the Bureau, I appointed somebody else. I then received a letter from
the mother, saying that I was most ungrateful, since I declined to make her a
happy woman as I could have done by a turn of my hand. She complained further
that she had labored with her state delegation and got all the votes for an
administration bill in which I was especially interested and this was the way I
had rewarded her.</span></p>

you get a letter like that, the first thing you do is to think how you can be
severe with a person who has committed an impropriety, or even been a little
impertinent. Then you may compose an answer. Then if you are wise, you will put
the letter in a drawer and lock the drawer. Take it out in the course of two
days - such communications will always bear two days' delay in answering - and
when you take it out after that interval, you will not send it. That is just
the course I took. After that, I sat down and wrote her just as polite a letter
as I could, telling her I realized a mother's disappointment under such
circumstances, but that really the appointment was not left to my mere personal
preference, that I had to select a man with technical qualifications, and had,
therefore, to follow the recommendations of the head of the Bureau. I expressed
the hope that her son would go on to accomplish what she had hoped for him in
the position which he then had. That mollified her and she wrote me a note

the appointment I sent in was not confirmed at once, and after an interval I

the nervous prostration that had followed her disappointment in this case, she
had to take to her bed and had developed a most serious case of cancer of the
stomach. Would I not restore her to health by withdrawing the first name and
replacing it by her son's? I had to write another letter, this one to the
husband, to say that I hoped the diagnosis would prove to be inaccurate, that I
sympathized with him in the sorrow he must have in the serious illness of his
wife, but that it was impossible to withdraw the name sent in. The man whom I appointed
was confirmed, and within two days after I received that letter, we gave a

commercials abound with examples of the use of dramatic techniques in selling
products. Sit down one evening in front of your television set and analyze what
the advertisers do in each of their presentations. You will note how an antacid
medicine changes the color of the acid in a test tube while its competitor
doesn't, how one brand of soap or detergent gets a greasy shirt clean when the
other brand leaves it gray. You'll see a car maneuver around a series of turns
and curves - far better than just being told about it. Happy faces will show
contentment with a variety of products. All of these dramatize for the viewer
the advantages offered by whatever is being sold - and they do get people to
buy them.</span></p>

on April 26, 1863, during the darkest period of the Civil War. For eighteen
months, Lincoln's generals had been leading the Union Army from one tragic
defeat to another. Nothing but futile, stupid human butchery. The nation was
appalled. Thousands of soldiers had deserted from the army, and en the
Republican members of the Senate had revolted and wanted to force Lincoln out
of the White House. &quot;We are now on the brink of destruction,&quot; Lincoln
said. It appears to me that even the Almighty is against us. I can hardly see a
ray of hope.&quot; Such was the black sorrow and chaos out of which this letter

the negative things they were doing; it was really tough to find things to
praise. We managed to find something, and within the first day or two some of
the really upsetting things they were doing quit happening. Then some of their
other faults began to disappear. They began capitalizing on the praise we were
giving them. They even began going out of their way to do things right. Neither
of us could believe it. Of course, it didn't last forever, but the norm reached
after things leveled off was so much better. It was no longer necessary to
react the way we used to. The children were doing far more right things than
wrong ones.&quot; All of this was a result of praising the slightest
improvement in the children rather than condemning everything they did wrong.</span></p>

1970 my son David, who was then fifteen years old, came to live with me in
Cincinnati. He had led a rough life. In 1958 his head was cut open in a car
accident, leaving a very bad scar on his forehead. In 1960 his mother and I
were divorced and he moved to Dallas, Texas, with his mother. Until he was
fifteen he had spent most of his school years in special classes for slow
learners in the Dallas school system. Possibly because of the scar, school
administrators had decided he was brain-injured and could not function at a
normal level. He was two years behind his age group, so he was only in the
seventh grade. Yet he did not know his multiplication tables, added on his
fingers and could barely read.</span></p>

was one positive point. He loved to work on radio and TV sets. He wanted to
become a TV technician. I encouraged this and pointed out that he needed math
to qualify for the training. I decided to help him become proficient in this
subject. We obtained four sets of flash cards: multiplication, division,
addition and subtraction. As we went through the cards, we put the correct
answers in a discard stack. When David missed one, I gave him the correct
answer and then put the card in the repeat stack until there were no cards
left. I made a big deal out of each card he got right, particularly if he had
missed it previously. Each night we would go through the repeat stack until
there were no cards left.</span></p>

night we timed the exercise with a stop watch. I promised him that when he
could get all the cards correct in eight minutes with no incorrect answers, we
would quit doing it every night. This seemed an impossible goal to David. The
first night it took 52 minutes, the second night, 48, then 45, 44, 41 then
under 40 minutes. We celebrated each reduction. I'd call in my wife, and we
would both hug him and we'd all dance a jig. At the end of the month he was
doing all the cards perfectly in less than eight minutes. When he made a small
improvement he would ask to do it again. He had made the fantastic discovery
that learning was easy and fun.</span></p>

his grades in algebra took a jump. It is amazing how much easier algebra is
when you can multiply. He astonished himself by bringing home a B in math. That
had never happened before. Other changes came with almost unbelievable
rapidity. His reading improved rapidly, and he began to use his natural talents
in drawing. Later in the school year his science teacher assigned him to
develop an exhibit. He chose to develop a highly complex series of models to
demonstrate the effect of levers. It required skill not only in drawing and
model making but in applied mathematics. The exhibit took first prize in his
school's science fair and was entered in the city competition and won third

Wilson didn't always employ such taut. If he had, history might have been

take such prominent Republican leaders as Elihu Root or Charles Evans Hughes or
Henry Cabot Lodge to the peace conference with him. Instead, he took along
unknown men from his own party. He snubbed the Republicans, refused to let them
feel that the League was their idea as well as his, refused to let them have a

wrecked his own career, ruined his health, shortened his life, caused America
to stay out of the League, and altered the history of the world.</span></p>

who was mowing underneath wouldn't have to stop to pick them up. He didn't like
this chore, and frequently it was either not done at all or it was done so
poorly that the mower had to stop and pick up several pears that he had missed.
Rather than have an eyeball-to-eyeball confrontation about it, one day I said
to him: 'Jeff, I'll make a deal with you. For every bushel basket full of pears
you pick up, I'll pay you one dollar. But after you are finished, for every
pear I find left in the yard, I'll take away a dollar. How does that sound?' As

harvested results that were rated twice as good as miracles. Rated by whom? By

if his replies had ever soared to 20 per cent, he would have regarded it as
nothing short of a miracle.</span></p>

years ago, Napoleon III of France, nephew of Napoleon Bonaparte, fell in love
with Marie Eugenic Ignace Augustine de Montijo, Countess of Teba, the most
beautiful woman in the world— and married her. His advisors pointed out that
she was only the daughter of an insignificant Spanish count. But Napoleon
retorted: &quot;What of it?&quot; Her grace, her youth, her charm, her beauty
filled him with divine felicity. In a speech hurled from the throne, he defied
an entire nation: &quot;I have preferred a woman I love and respect,&quot; he

France, neither the power of his love nor the might of his throne, could keep
her from nagging. Bedeviled by jealousy, devoured by suspicion, she flouted his
orders, she denied him even a show of privacy. She broke into his office while
he was engaged in affairs of state. She interrupted his most important

what did Eugenic accomplish by all this? Here is the answer. I am quoting now
from E.A. Rheinhardt's engrossing book, Napoleon and Eugenic: The Tragicomedy
of an Empire: &quot;So it came about that Napoleon frequently would steal out
by a little side door at night, with a soft hat pulled over his eyes, and,
accompanied by one of his intimates, really betake himself to some fair lady
who was expecting him, or else stroll about the great city as of old, passing
through streets of the kind which an Emperor hardly sees outside a fairy tale,

is what nagging accomplished for Eugenic. True, she sat on the throne of
France. True, she was the most beautiful woman in the world. But neither royalty
nor beauty can keep love alive amidst the poisonous fumes of nagging. Eugenic
could have raised her voice like Job of old and have wailed: &quot;The thing
which I greatly feared is come upon me.&quot; Come upon her? She brought it
upon herself, poor woman, by her jealousy and her nagging. Of all the
sure-fire, infernal devices ever invented by all the devils in hell for
destroying love, nagging is the deadliest. It never fails. Like the bite of the
