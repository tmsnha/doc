People</span></i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:102%'> was first
published in 1937 in an edition of only five thousand copies. Neither Dale
Carnegie nor the publishers, Simon and Schuster, anticipated more than this
modest sale. To their amazement, the book became an overnight sensation, and
edition after edition rolled off the presses to keep up with the increasing
public demand. <i>How to Win Friends and Influence People</i> took its place in
publishing history as one of the all-time international bestsellers. It touched
a nerve and filled a human need that was more than a faddish phenomenon of
post-Depression days, as evidenced by its continued and uninterrupted sales
into the eighties, almost half a century later.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:9.7pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:21.0pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:
104%'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:104%'>Dale Carnegie used to say
that it was easier to make a million dollars than to put a phrase into the
English language. <i>How to Win Friends and Influence People</i> became such a
phrase, quoted, paraphrased, parodied, used in innumerable contexts from
political cartoon to novels. The book itself was translated into almost every
known written language. Each generation has discovered it anew and has found it
relevant.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:9.65pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:7.0pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:112%'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:112%'>Which brings us to the logical
question: Why revise a book that has proven and continues to prove its vigorous
and universal appeal? Why tamper with success?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:101%'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:101%'>To answer that, we must realize that
Dale Carnegie himself was a tireless reviser of his own work during his
lifetime. <i>How to Win Friends and Influence People</i> was written to be used
as a textbook for his courses in Effective Speaking and Human Relations and is
still used in those courses today. Until his death in 1955 he constantly
improved and revised the course itself to make it applicable to the evolving
needs of an ever - growing public. No one was more sensitive to the changing
currents of present-day life than Dale Carnegie. He constantly improved and
refined his methods of teaching; he updated his book on Effective Speaking
several times. Had he lived longer, he himself would have revised <i>How to Win
Friends and Influence People</i> to better reflect the changes that have taken
place in the world since the thirties.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:10.0pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:2.0pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:104%'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:104%'>Many of the names of prominent people
in the book, well known at the time of first publication, are no longer
recognized by many of today’s readers. Certain examples and phrases seem as
quaint and dated in our social climate as those in a Victorian novel. The
important message and overall impact of the book is weakened to that extent.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:9.55pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:102%'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:102%'>Our purpose, therefore, in this
revision is to clarify and strengthen the book for a modern reader without
tampering with the content. We have not “changed” <i>How to Win Friends and
Influence People</i> except to make a few excisions and add a few more
contemporary examples. The brash, breezy Carnegie style is intact— even the
thirties slang is still there. Dale Carnegie wrote as he spoke, in an
intensively exuberant, colloquial, conversational manner.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:9.85pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:104%'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:104%'>So his voice still speaks as
forcefully as ever, in the book and in his work. Thousands of people all over
the world are being trained in Carnegie courses in increasing numbers each
year. And other thousands are reading and studying <i>How to Win Friends and

style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:103%'>During the first thirty-five years of
the twentieth century, the publishing houses of America printed more than a
fifth of a million different books. Most of them were deadly dull, and many
were financial failures. “Many,” did I say? The president of one of the largest
publishing houses in the world confessed to me that his company, after
seventy-five years of publishing experience, still lost money on seven out of
every eight books it published.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:1.0pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:104%'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:104%'>I have, since 1912, been conducting
educational courses for business and professional men and women in New York. At
first, I conducted courses in public speaking only—courses designed to train
adults, by actual experience, to think on their feet and express their ideas
with more clarity, more effectiveness and more poise, both in business
interviews and before groups.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:9.65pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:106%'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:106%'>But gradually, as the seasons passed,
I realized that as sorely as these adults needed training in effective
speaking, they needed still more training in the fine art of getting along with
people in everyday business and social contacts.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:9.3pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:5.0pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:106%'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:106%'>I also gradually realized that I was
sorely in need of such training myself. As I look back across the years, I am
appalled at my own frequent lack of finesse and understanding. How I wish a
book such as this had been placed in my hands twenty years ago! What a
priceless boon it would have been.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:9.2pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:2.0pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:102%'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:102%'>Dealing with people is probably the
biggest problem you face, especially if you are in business. Yes, and that is
also true if you are a housewife, architect or engineer. Research done a few
years ago under the auspices of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of
Teaching uncovered a most important and significant fact—a fact later confirmed
by additional studies made at the Carnegie Institute of Technology. These
investigations revealed that even in such technical lines as engineering, about
15 percent of one’s financial success is due to one’s technical knowledge and
about 85 percent is due to skill in human engineering, to personality and the
ability to lead people.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:9.8pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:2.0pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:101%'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:101%'>For many years, I conducted courses
each season at the Engineers’ Club of Philadelphia, and also courses for the
New York Chapter of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers. A total of
probably more than fifteen hundred engineers have passed through my classes.
They came to me because they had finally realized, after years of observation
and experience, that the highest-paid personnel in engineering are frequently
not those who know the most about engineering. One can for example, hire mere
technical ability in engineering, accountancy, architecture or any other
profession at nominal salaries. But the person who has technical knowledge plus
the ability to express ideas, to assume leadership, and to arouse enthusiasm
among people—that person is headed for higher earning power.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:2.0pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:106%'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:106%'>In the heyday of his activity, John
D. Rockefeller said that “the ability to deal with people is as purchasable a
commodity as sugar or coffee.” “And I will pay more for that ability,” said
John D., “than for any other under the sun.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:9.35pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:3.0pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:106%'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:106%'>Wouldn’t you suppose that every
college in the land would conduct courses to develop the highest-priced ability
under the sun? But if there is just one practical, commonsense course of that
kind given for adults in even one college in the land, it has escaped my
attention up to the present writing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:9.3pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:9.0pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:103%'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:103%'>That survey cost $25,000 and took two
years. The last part of the survey was made in Meriden, Connecticut. It had
been chosen as a typical American town. Every adult in Meriden was interviewed
and requested to answer 156 questions—questions such as “What is your business
or profession? Your education? How do you spend your spare time? What is your
income? Your hobbies? Your ambitions? Your problems? What subjects are you most
interested in studying?” And so on. That survey revealed that health is the
prime</span></p>

diligently for a practical textbook on the subject and found not one. Finally
they approached one of the world’s outstanding authorities on adult education
and asked him if he knew of any book that met the needs of this group. “No,” he
replied, &quot;I know what those adults want. But the book they need has never

everything that I could find on the subject—everything from newspaper columns,
magazine articles, records of the family courts, the writings of the old
philosophers and the new psychologists. In addition, I hired a trained
researcher to spend one and a half years in various libraries reading
everything I had missed, plowing through erudite tomes on psychology, poring
over hundreds of magazine articles, searching through countless biographies,
trying to ascertain how the great leaders of all ages had dealt with people. We
read their biographies; we read the life stories of all great leaders from
Julius Caesar to Thomas Edison. I recall that we read over one hundred
biographies of Theodore Roosevelt alone. We were determined to spare no time,
no expense, to discover every practical idea that anyone had ever used
throughout the ages for winning friends and influencing people.</span></p>

successful people, some of them world-famous inventors like Marconi and Edison;
political leaders like Franklin D. Roosevelt and James Farley; business leaders
like Owen D. Young; movie stars like Clark Gable and Mary Pickford, and

in human relations.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:3.0pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:106%'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:106%'>From all this material, I prepared a
short talk. I called it “How to Win Friends and Influence People”. I say
“short.” It was short in the beginning, but it soon expanded to a lecture that
consumed one hour and thirty minutes. For years, I gave this talk each season
to the adults in the Carnegie Institute courses in New York.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:9.3pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:104%'><span

listeners to go out and test it in their business and social contacts, and then
come back to class and speak about their experiences and the results they had
achieved. What an interesting assignment! These men and women, hungry for
self-improvement, were fascinated by the idea of working in a new kind of
laboratory—the first and only laboratory of human relationships for adults that
had ever existed.</span></p>

of life. His organization is now inspired with a new loyalty, a new enthusiasm,
a new spirit of teamwork. Three hundred and fourteen enemies have been turned
into 314 friends. As he proudly said in a speech before the class: “When I used

example, when you are displeased, it is much easier to criticize and condemn

easier to find fault than to find praise. It is more natural to talk about what
you want than to talk about what the other person wants and so on. So, as you
read this book, remember that you are not merely trying to acquire information.
You are attempting to form new habits. Ah yes, you are attempting a new way of
life. That will require time and persistence and daily application.</span></p>

detectives laid siege to his top-floor hideaway. They chopped holes in the
roof; they tried to smoke out Crowley, the “cop killer,” with teargas. Then
they mounted their machine guns on surrounding buildings, and for more than an
hour one of New York’s fine residential areas reverberated with the crack of
pistol fire and the <i>rut-tat-tat</i> of machine guns. Crowley, crouching
behind an over-stuffed chair, fired incessantly at the police. Ten thousand

himself? We know, because while the police were firing into his apartment, he
wrote a letter addressed “To whom it may concern, ” and, as he wrote, the blood

Crowley said, “Under my coat is a weary heart, but a kind one—one that would do

quarrel that split the Republican party, put Woodrow Wilson in the White House,

of history. Let’s review the facts quickly. When Theodore Roosevelt stepped out
of the White House in 1908, he supported Taft, who was elected President. Then
Theodore Roosevelt went off to Africa to shoot lions. When he returned, he
exploded. He denounced Taft for his conservatism, tried to secure the
nomination for a third term himself, formed the Bull Moose party, and all but
demolished the G.O.P. In the election that followed, William Howard Taft and
the Republican party carried only two states—Vermont and Utah. The most

banish the child to his room and tell him he’d just better make up his mind to
go. He had no choice. But tonight, recognizing that this would not really help
Tim start kindergarten in the best frame of mind, Stan sat down and thought,
“If I were Tim, why would I be excited about going to kindergarten?” He and his
wife made a list of all the fun things Tim would do such as finger painting,
singing songs, making new friends. Then they put them into action. “We all started
finger- painting on the kitchen table—my wife, Lil, my other son Bob, and
myself, all having fun. Soon Tim was peeping around the corner. Next he was
begging to participate. ‘Oh, no! You have to go to kindergarten first to learn
how to finger-paint.’ With all the enthusiasm I could muster I went through the
list talking in terms he could understand, telling him all the fun he would
have in kindergarten. The next morning, I thought I was the first one up. I
went downstairs and found Tim sitting sound asleep in the living room chair.
‘What are you doing here?’ I asked. ‘I’m waiting to go to kindergarten. I don’t
want to be late.’ The enthusiasm of our entire family had aroused in Tim an
eager want that no amount of discussion or threat could have possibly
accomplished.”</span></p>

and forty-seven minutes. He called in another executive who had written a book
on chain stores. He wrote to the National Chain Store Association and secured
for me a copy of a debate on the subject. He feels that the chain store is
rendering a real service to humanity. He is proud of what he is doing for
hundreds of communities. His eyes fairly glowed as he talked, and I must
confess that he opened my eyes to things I had never even dreamed of. He
changed my whole mental attitude. As I was leaving, he walked with me to the
door, put his arm around my shoulder, wished me well in my debate, and asked me
to stop in and see him again and let him know how I made out. The last words he

I once organized a public-speaking course in Paris and sent form letters to all

people just called him “Nick.” Levy told us, “I made a special effort to say
his name over several times to myself before I made my call. When I greeted him
by his full name, ‘Good afternoon, Mr. Nicodemus Papadoulos,’ he was shocked.
For what seemed like several minutes there was no reply from him at all.

wanted merely a friendly, sympathetic listener to whom he could unburden

times was Sigmund Freud. A man who met Freud described his manner of listening,
“It struck me so forcibly that I shall never forget him. He had qualities which
I had never seen in any other man. Never had I seen such concentrated
attention. There was none of that piercing ‘soul-penetrating gaze’ business.
His eyes were mild and genial. His voice was low and kind. His gestures were
few. But the attention he gave me, his appreciation of what I said, even when I
said it badly, was extraordinary. <i>You've no idea what it meant to be
listened to like that.</i>”</span></p>

young man who has such an exalted opinion of my ability,” Rossetti probably

I, I learned an invaluable lesson one night in London. I was manager at the
time for Sir Ross Smith. During the war, Sir Ross had been the Australian ace
out in Palestine; and shortly after peace was declared, he astonished the world
by flying halfway around it in thirty days. No such feat had ever been
attempted before. It created a tremendous sensation. The Australian government awarded
him fifty thousand dollars; the King of England knighted him; and, for a while,
he was the most talked-about man under the Union Jack. I was attending a
banquet one night given in Sir Ross’s honor; and during the dinner, the man
sitting next to me told a humorous story which hinged on the quotation “There’s
a divinity that shapes our ends, rough-hew them how we will.”</span></p>

‘undoubtedly,’ etc., and I adopted, instead of them, ‘I conceive,’ ‘I

myself the pleasure of contradicting him abruptly, and of showing immediately

in certain cases or circumstances his opinion would be right, but in the
present case there appear’d or seem’d to me some difference, etc. I soon found the
advantage of this change in my manner; the conversations I engag’d in went on

speech, in its entirety, is a masterpiece. It produced astonishing results. It

none of the withdrawal activities takes place. The organism is in a

replied, ‘Yes, several years ago.’ He reminded me that I probably paid $25 to
$30 for the rental. I said ‘yes’ again. He then asked if I was the kind of
person who liked to save money. Naturally, I answered ‘yes.’ He went on to
explain that they had bow sets with all the necessary equipment on sale for
$34.95. I could buy a complete set for only $4.95 more than I could rent one.
He explained that is why they had discontinued renting them. Did I think that
was reasonable? My ‘yes’ response led to a purchase of the set, and when I picked
it up I purchased several more items at this shop and have since become a

way of raising the money over the weekend, so when I received his phone call
first thing on Monday morning I expected the worst. Instead of becoming upset I
looked at the situation from his point of view. I apologized most sincerely for
causing him so much inconvenience and remarked that I must be his most
troublesome customer as this was not the first time I was behind in my
payments. His tone of voice changed immediately, and he reassured me that I was
far from being one of his really troublesome customers. He went on to tell me
several examples of how rude his customers sometimes were, how they lied to him
and often tried to avoid talking to him at all. I said nothing. I listened and
let him pour out his troubles to me. Then, without any suggestion from me, he
said it did not matter if I couldn’t pay all the money immediately. It would be
all right if I paid him $20 by the end of the month and made up the balance
whenever it was convenient for me to do so.”</span></p>

author of <i>Little Women,</i> Louisa May Alcott. Naturally, I knew she had
lived and written her immortal books in Concord, Massachusetts. But, without
thinking what I was saying, I spoke of visiting her old home in Concord. New
Hampshire. If I had said New Hampshire only once, it might have been forgiven.
But, alas and alack! I said it twice, I was deluged with letters and telegrams,
stinging messages that swirled around my defenseless head like a swarm of
hornets. Many were indignant. A few insulting. One Colonial Dame, who had been
reared in Concord, Massachusetts, and who was then living in Philadelphia,
vented her scorching wrath upon me. She couldn’t have been much more bitter if
I had accused Miss Alcott of being a cannibal from New Guinea. As I read the
letter, I said to myself, “Thank God, I am not married to that woman.” I felt
like writing and telling her that although I had made a mistake in geography,
she had made a far greater mistake in common courtesy. That was to be just my
opening sentence. Then I was going to roll up my sleeves and tell her what I
really thought. But I didn’t. I controlled myself. I realized that any
hotheaded fool could do that, and that most fools would do just that.</span></p>

correct. To put it differently and perhaps mare clearly, people are honest and
want to discharge their obligations. The exceptions to that rule are
comparatively few, and I am convinced that the individuals who are inclined to

soap or detergent gets a greasy shirt clean when the other brand leaves it
gray. You’ll see a car maneuver around a series of turns and curves—far better

battle.) Lincoln probably dashed this letter off in five minutes; yet it sold
at public auction in 1926 for twelve thousand dollars, and that, by the way,
was more money than Lincoln was able to save during half a century of hard
work. The letter was written to General Joseph Hooker on April 26, 1863, during
the darkest period of the Civil War. For eighteen months, Lincoln’s generals
had been leading the Union Army from one tragic defeat to another. Nothing but
futile, stupid human butchery. The nation was appalled. Thousands of soldiers
had deserted from the army, and then the Republican members of the Senate had
revolted and wanted to force Lincoln out of the White House. “We are now on the
brink of destruction,” Lincoln said. It appears to me that even the Almighty is
against us. I can hardly see a ray of hope.” Such was the black sorrow and

rewrote and polished his sermon with the meticulous care of a Flaubert. Then he
read it to his wife. It was poor - as most written speeches are. She might have
said, if she had had less judgment, “Lyman, that is terrible. That’ll never do.
You’ll put people to sleep. It reads like an encyclopedia. You ought to know better
than that after all the years you have been preaching. For heaven’s sake, why
don’t you talk like a human being? Why don’t you act natural? You’ll disgrace
yourself if you ever read that stuff.”</span></p>

American Review.</i> In other words, she praised it and at the same time subtly
suggested that it wouldn’t do as a speech. Lyman Abbott saw the point, tore up
his carefully prepared manuscript and preached without even using notes.</span></p>

declared that he was the only German who felt friendly toward the English; that

had saved England from being humbled in the dust by Russia and France; that it

with Miss Ida Tarbell, the dean of American biographers. When I told her I was
writing this book, we began discussing this all-important subject of getting
along with people, and she told me that while she was writing her biography of
Owen D. Young, she interviewed a man who had sat for three years in the same
office with Mr. Young. This man declared that during all that time he had never
heard Owen D. Young give a direct order to anyone. He always gave suggestions,
not orders. Owen D. Young never said, for example, “Do this or do that,” or
“Don’t do this or don’t do that.” He would say, “You might consider this,” or
“Do you think that would work?” Frequently he would say, after he had dictated
a letter, “What do you think of this?” In looking over a letter of one of his
assistants, he would say, “Maybe if we were to phrase it this way it would be
better.” He always gave people the opportunity to do things themselves; he
never told his assistants to do things; he let them do them, let them learn
from their mistakes.</span></p>

may last a long time—even if the order was given to correct an obviously bad
situation. Dan Santarelli, a teacher at a vocational school in Wyoming,
Pennsylvania, told one of our classes how one of his students had blocked the
entrance way to one of the school’s shops by illegally parking his car in it.
One of the other instructors stormed into the classroom and asked in an
arrogant tone, “Whose car is blocking the driveway?” When the student who owned
the car responded, the instructor screamed: “Move that car and move it right
now, or I’ll wrap a chain around it and drag it out of there.”</span></p>

his job unpleasant.</span></p>

him. He had never been able to attend school more than four years. His father
had been flung in jail because he couldn’t pay his debts, and this young man

attic room with two other boys—guttersnipes from the slums of London. He had so
little confidence in his ability to write that he sneaked out and mailed his
first manuscript in the dead of night so nobody would laugh at him. Story after
story was refused. Finally the great day came when one was accepted. True, he
wasn’t paid a shilling for it, but one editor had praised him. One editor had

was really tough to find things to praise. We managed to find something, and
within the first day or two some of the really upsetting things they were doing
quit happening. Then some of their other faults began to disappear. They began
capitalizing on the praise we were giving them. They even began going out of
their way to do things right. Neither of us could believe it. Of course, it
didn’t last forever, but the norm reached after things leveled off was so much
better. It was no longer necessary to react the way we used to. The children
were doing far more right things than wrong ones.” All of this was a result of

style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:102%'>“In 1970 my son David, who was then
fifteen years old, came to live with me in Cincinnati. He had led a rough life.
In 1958 his head was cut open in a car accident, leaving a very bad scar on his
forehead. In 1960 his mother and I were divorced and he moved to Dallas, Texas,
with his mother. Until he was fifteen he had spent most of his school years in
special classes for slow learners in the Dallas school system. Possibly because
of the scar, school administrators had decided he was brain-injured and could
not function at a normal level. He was two years behind his age group, so he
was only in the seventh grade. Yet he did not know his multiplication tables,
added on his fingers and could barely read.</span></p>

style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:102%'>“There was one positive point. He
loved to work on radio and TV sets. He wanted to become a TV technician. I
encouraged this and pointed out that he needed math to qualify for the
training. I decided to help him become proficient in this subject. We obtained
four sets of flash cards: multiplication, division, addition and subtraction.
As we went through the cards, we put the correct answers in a discard stack.
When David missed one, I gave him the correct answer and then put the card in
the repeat stack until there were no cards left. I made a big deal out of each
card he got right, particularly if he had missed it previously. Each night we
would go through the repeat stack until there were no cards left.</span></p>

style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:102%'>Each night we timed the exercise with
a stopwatch. I promised him that when he could get all the cards correct in
eight minutes with no incorrect answers, we would quit doing it every night.
This seemed an impossible goal to David. The first night it took 52 minutes,
the second night, 48, then 45, 44, 41 then under 40 minutes. We celebrated each
reduction. I’d call in my wife, and we would both hug him and we’d all dance a
jig. At the end of the month he was doing all the cards perfectly in less than
eight minutes. When he made a small improvement he would ask to do it again. He
had made the fantastic discovery that learning was easy and fun.</span></p>

a jump. It is amazing how much easier algebra is when you can multiply. He
astonished himself by bringing home a B in math. That had never happened
before. Other changes came with almost unbelievable rapidity. His reading
improved rapidly, and he began to use his natural talents in drawing. Later in
the school year his science teacher assigned him to develop an exhibit. He
chose to develop a highly complex series of models to demonstrate the effect of
levers. It required skill not only in drawing and model making but in applied
mathematics. The exhibit took first prize in his school’s science fair and was
entered in the city competition and won third prize for the entire city of
Cincinnati.</span></p>

had been told he was ‘brain-damaged,’ who had been called ‘Frankenstein’ by his

Suddenly he discovered he could really learn and accomplish things. The result?
From the last quarter of the eighth grade all the way through high school, he
never failed to make the honor roll; in high school he was elected to the
national honor society. Once he found learning was easy, his whole life
